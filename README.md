## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- Stripe account and API keys

### Installation

1. Star the repository.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rudyapollo/ecommerce-api-nodejs.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-api-nodejs
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you're using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   If you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the necessary values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have a database configured and running. Update the database connection details in the `.env.local` file.

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set up, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
#or
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

By default, the application will run on port `3000`. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` environment variable in the `.env.local` file.

## Deployment

This API can be deployed using various platforms such as Vercel, Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or your own server infrastructure.

Set up environment variables similar to how it's done in the local setup. Ensure that you provide appropriate values for your deployment environment.

Deploy the built application to your chosen platform. Each platform may have its own deployment process. Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for detailed instructions.

Monitor the deployed application for any issues. Make sure that it's running smoothly and handle any errors or performance issues as needed.
